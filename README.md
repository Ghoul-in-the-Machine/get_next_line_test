# get_next_line_test
A basic buffer size tester for 42 assignment Get Next Line.
Place get_next_line.c, get_next_line_utils.c and get_next_line.h in this folder. 

Change the buffer_size to see how your get_next_line performs. 
0 buffer size should function but not read anything. 
1 buffer size should function, even when dealing with the longest line (it just takes a while). 
1000000 buffer size should function, even when dealing with a lot of lines.

# Use Woof to exit the function at any point.
